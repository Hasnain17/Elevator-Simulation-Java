# Elevator-Simulation-Java
Starting from a hand powered elevator till reaching to what we are dealing with today of systematically complex one’s, clarify to us that technological development doesn’t stop, and whenever time is passing, new developments will be available to us helping to solve every problem we face. Simulation is a way of developing application or design simulating real world, the way which help in clarifying the real idea. The reasons upon using simulations may be for literature, cost, time, or safety reasons. The elevator challenge was born out of a long time curiosity in the control of elevators. Elevator simulation is becoming increasingly more flexible and powerful. Elevator simulation models of varying sophistication have been written and applied for many years. The continuing improvements in computer technology and software development tools make increasing complex and comprehensive simulation models feasible.
